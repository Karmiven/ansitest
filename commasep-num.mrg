# Returns a passed number as comma-separated e.g. pass $1 = 80000000000 and receive 80,000,000,000

function commanum () { 
  LC_NUMERIC=en_US printf "%'.f" $1
}

# test for interactive shell / OK to echo text 
#[ $(echo $- |grep i |wc -l) -gt 0 ] && 
[ ! "$1" = "" ] && commanum $1

# Example usage:
#$ tmpvar=$(./commasep-num.mrg 80000000000)
#$ echo $tmpvar
#80,000,000,000
# Limitation: it doesn't handle fractional numbers x.xx , just integers - anything after the decimal gets dropped
# so don't try to display Ï€ (pi) with it ;-)
